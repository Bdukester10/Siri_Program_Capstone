# Siri_Program_Capstone
This project started when my school started a program called "Capstone Project". This was in 8th grade. Me and my friends all had a deep intrest in computers, and we wanted to take it to the next level. We talked to the school's principal and got a little bit of funding for the project.
Our first Idea was to simply build computers, but soon enough we realised that that would not be enough for a whole years work. So I decided that I wanted to persue my passion of programming in python.
