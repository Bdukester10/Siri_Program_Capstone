# Siri_Program_Capstone
This is the Siri-type program I coded for my capstone project. It is currently in really really early stages of creation. So there will be a lot of commits and changes!
I first decided to make this when SIRI and Cortana failed me many, many times. I finally decided that I had had enough of these programs and decided to make on of my own.
I started as a capstone project for my school, and then branched into a deep passion of mine. I decided that even after I had completed the school year and the work should be over, I would continue working on it. i really hope you enjoy this program I have been working on.
# Notes
Make sure you run the .bat file (windows only) or else the program will not function.
